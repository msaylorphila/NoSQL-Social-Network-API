## Description

This is the backend for a social network application that uses Mongoose and Express to build a NoSQL API. Through this backend one is able to create users, add friends, write thoughts for each user, and react to thoughts. They are also able to update and delete thoughts and users, as well as delete friends and reactions. If a user is deleted their thoughts will be deleted as well.
